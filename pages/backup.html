					<p>Your subscription to the Services (as defined in the Ancestry <a href="https://www.ancestry.com/cs/legal/termsandconditions">Terms and Conditions</a>) and purchase of AncestryDNA® and AncestryHealth® is subject to these Renewal and Cancellation Terms. Capitalized terms used in these Renewal and Cancellation Terms if not defined here are as defined in the <a href="https://www.ancestry.com/cs/legal/termsandconditions">Terms and Conditions</a>.</p>

<p><strong><u>Subscriptions</u></strong></p>

<p>There are various payment and subscription options available for using the Services. These options can be found in the individual Services and may change from time to time. Once you register for a free trial or your initial payment is processed, your subscription has begun, and you can immediately access the relevant Service.</p>

<p><strong>1. Automatic Renewals of Subscriptions</strong>. Unless otherwise noted in the terms of your offer, subscriptions automatically renew, except for gift and pay-per-view subscriptions. This means that once you sign up for a free trial or become a subscribing member, your subscription will automatically renew based on the subscription program you chose (e.g. semiannually, monthly, etc.). You will be charged the rate stated at the time of purchase (plus applicable taxes, such as value added tax when the stated rate doesn’t include VAT) at the beginning of each billing term of your subscription via the billing method you have provided to us. Please ensure that your billing information is correct to prevent an interruption in your subscription.</p>

<p>Prices and terms for subscriptions may change at any time. The price and terms in place when you made your initial purchase or when your subscription last renewed will stay in effect for the duration of that subscription period, but new prices and terms may apply to renewals or new subscriptions. Ancestry will give you reasonable notice of any change in price or terms before they go into effect. If you do not want to renew your subscription under these new prices or terms, you may cancel your subscription as described below.</p>

<p><strong>2. Subscription Cancellations and Refunds</strong>. You may cancel your Ancestry subscription by logging into your My Account page or by <a href="https://support.ancestry.com/s/contactsupport">contacting us</a>. Learn more about how to cancel your Ancestry subscription <a href="https://support.ancestry.com/s/article/Canceling-a-Subscription">here</a>. If you access Fold3® and Newspapers.com™ through an Ancestry All Access subscription, you may cancel your subscription by logging into your My Account page or by <a href="https://support.ancestry.com/s/contactsupport">contacting us</a>. If you subscribe to Fold3® or Newspapers.com™ separately, see below for cancellation details. All refunds will be credited to the billing method associated with your account. For information on how to cancel a subscription purchased through the Ancestry app, go <a href="https://support.ancestry.com/s/article/Canceling-a-Subscription-from-the-Ancestry-App" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>

<p>If you are using the Services in the EU or UK, you may also cancel your subscription by filling out this <a href="https://support.ancestry.co.uk/s/email-us">contact form</a>.</p>

<p>You may cancel your Fold3® subscription by logging into your <a href="https://www.fold3.com/account" target="_blank">Account Details</a> page on Fold3.com or by contacting us <a href="https://www.fold3.com/contact" target="_blank">here</a>. You may cancel your Newspapers.com™ subscription by logging into your <a href="https://www.newspapers.com/account/subscription " target="_blank">Account Details</a> page on Newspapers.com or by contacting us <a href="https://www.newspapers.com/contact/" target="_blank">here</a>.

<p>Unless otherwise stated in the terms of your subscription, the following terms will apply:</p>

<p style="margin-left:.5in;"><u>Free Trials</u>: Some of the Services allow you to register for a free trial so you can try the Services before starting a paid subscription. If you register for a free trial, you may cancel at any time prior to two days before the end of the free trial period and incur no charge. If you do not cancel by that time, your paid subscription will start once your free trial period ends. One free trial per user. After a free trial bills through, no refunds will be issued. For users located in the European Union, your free trial is inclusive of your cooling off rights.</p>

<p style="margin-left:.5in;"><u>Monthly Subscriptions</u>: Subscriptions billed on a monthly basis may be canceled at any time prior to two business days before your renewal date but are not eligible for a refund. If you cancel your monthly subscription, you will retain access to your Services for the remainder of that month. If you do not cancel your subscription prior to two days before your renewal date, we will renew your subscription for one more month.</p>

<p style="margin-left:.5in;"><u>Subscriptions Longer than a Month, Billed Upfront</u>:</p>

<ul class="bulleted" style="margin-left:1in;">
	<li><strong><u>For Ancestry subscriptions</u>: </strong>Except as outlined below, if you cancel this type of subscription before the end of your subscription period, you are not eligible for a refund, but you will retain access to the relevant Services for the remainder of your subscription period, after which your subscription will be cancelled. If your subscription did not begin with a free trial, during the first 14 days of your first subscription term you may either (1) cancel immediately for a full refund and immediate loss of access, or (2) cancel at the end of your current subscription, with no refund. If you do not cancel your subscription within your subscription period, we will renew your subscription for additional terms equivalent in length to your current subscription, until you cancel. After your subscription renews, you are not eligible for any refunds. Refunds are not based on account usage.</li>
	<li><strong><u>For Fold3, Newspapers.com, and Archives subscriptions</u>: </strong>Subscriptions longer than one month that are billed upfront may be canceled during the first 30 days for a full refund. If this subscription begins with a free trial, the 30 day period begins after the free trial ends. If you cancel this type of subscription after the first 30 days of your first subscription term, you will not receive a refund, but you will retain access to the relevant Services for the remainder of your subscription period, after which your subscription will be canceled. If you do not cancel your subscription within your subscription period, we will renew your subscription for additional terms equivalent in length to your current subscription, until you cancel. After your subscription renews, you are not eligible for any refunds. Refunds are not based on account usage.</li>
</ul>

<p style="margin-left:.5in;"><u>Subscriptions Longer than a Month, Billed Monthly:</u> Where offered, some subscriptions longer than a month may be eligible for monthly billing. Even though you will be billed monthly, you are committing to the entire length of your subscription (e.g. 6 months or 12 months). Except as outlined below, if you cancel this type of subscription before the end of your subscription term, you are not eligible for a refund, but you will retain access to the relevant Services for the remainder of any paid months (after which your subscription will be cancelled), and you may be charged a cancellation fee. If your subscription did not begin with a free trial, during the first 14 days of your first subscription term you may either (1) cancel immediately for a full refund of the first month’s fee and immediate loss of access, or (2) cancel at the end of the first month, subject to a cancellation fee. Cancellation fees are the lesser of (i) $25 for 6-month subscriptions or $50 for 12-month subscriptions (plus any applicable taxes) or (ii) the remaining cost of your subscription. If you do not cancel your subscription within your subscription period, we will renew your subscription for additional terms equivalent in length to your current subscription, until you cancel. After your subscription renews, you are not eligible for any refunds.</p>

<p style="margin-left:.5in;"><u>Gift Memberships</u>: Gift memberships may be canceled by the purchaser for a full refund before the earlier of (a) 30 days after the date the gift is purchased and (b) the gift start date selected by the purchaser. No refunds are available after the gift start date.</p>

<p><u>Pausing Your Subscription</u>: Where available, for subscriptions that automatically renew, you can choose to pause your subscription by delaying your renewal payment for up to 2 months at the end of your current billing cycle. You can only pause your subscription once per billing cycle, and once the pause begins, you will not be able to change the duration of the pause. You will lose access to any paid content for the duration of your pause. Your subscription will be reactivated automatically after the specified duration at the price at which it would have renewed prior to the pause, and you authorize your credit card to be charged for your subscription on a recurring basis upon reactivation. If you choose to cancel while your subscription is paused, you will not be charged.</p>

<p><u>Credits</u>: Some Services may be purchased as credits, in varying quantities, to be used over a period of time (e.g. Services on www.archives.com). Credits purchased are valid for the period specified at the time of purchase. Any credits unused within the period of permitted use will expire following the expiration date.</p>

<p><u>Taxes and Fees</u>: You will be responsible for all taxes and fees charged by other companies such as shipping, mobile carrier fees, data plan charges, overdraft fees, credit card fees, and foreign transaction fees.</p>
