<p><a name="intro"></a><strong>1.&nbsp;&nbsp;Introduction</strong></p>

<p>At Ancestry, we empower journeys of personal discovery to enrich lives. To provide and improve the websites, mobile applications, and services (collectively the “<strong>Services</strong>”), we collect, process, and store "<strong>Personal Information</strong>," which is information that can identify you, such as your name, email or address, or information that could reasonably be linked back to you, including your <a href="#genetic-information">Genetic Information</a>. This Privacy Statement describes our practices for collecting, storing and processing your Personal Information and the controls we provide you to manage it within our Services. In addition, our <a href="/cs/legal/AboutCookies" target="_blank">Cookie Policy</a> describes our use of browser cookies and similar tracking technologies which is considered a part of this Privacy Statement.</p>

<p><strong>Please note</strong>: Information about deceased persons is not Personal Information under this Privacy Statement.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><a name="account-creation"></a><strong>2.&nbsp;&nbsp;Account Creation and Your Engagement with Ancestry Services</strong></p>

<p>The Personal Information required to create an account with Ancestry is limited to your name, an email address, and a password. For Archives® users only, billing information is also required for account creation.</p>

<p>Account creation also requires you to agree to the <a class="underline" href="/cs/legal/TermsAndConditions" target="_blank">Ancestry Terms and Conditions</a> and this Privacy Statement.</p>

<p>By creating an account you are telling us that you understand Ancestry will collect, process, and share your Personal Information (including your Genetic Information if you have taken a DNA test) as described in this Privacy Statement.</p>

<p>Access to Ancestry content such as archival records to help you build a family tree or to our DNA features (ethnicity estimate, etc.) requires additional personal information, including payment details, and, for the DNA test, the test code (when you activate your DNA test kit) and a saliva sample from which we can extract Genetic Information.</p>

<p>At any time, you can request that Ancestry delete information you have uploaded into your account, such as a family tree or your Genetic Information. You can also delete your entire account. Please see <a href="#deletion">Section 10</a> for specific details about deleting your data.</p>

<p><a name="retention"></a><strong>9.&nbsp;&nbsp;What Are Our Retention Practices?</strong></p>

<p>Ancestry Services are fundamentally premised on the notion that the personal voyage of self-discovery is not a one-time event and continues over lengthy periods of time—possibly lifetimes. Additionally, and with particular regard to our subscribers and DNA customers who pay fees or purchase subscriptions, the ongoing enhancement of our collections of historical records and DNA features provide benefits and insights to our Users over time. As a result, our retention practices reflect this ongoing value by retaining user accounts on our system until our Users inform us of their desire to delete their data or close their accounts.</p>

<p><strong>Genetic Information and Health Reports</strong></p>

<p>If the independent physician network partner approves your laboratory test, and, depending on which AncestryHealth® product you buy and whether we have your DNA Data from prior testing, Ancestry will either share your DNA Data, or send your sample for processing to our independent laboratory partner. Using your DNA Data, our independent laboratory partner will generate a test result, which Ancestry, in turn, will use to provide your health report.</p>

<p>Ancestry’s independent physician network will also have access to your test result and health report.</p>

<p><strong>Please note:</strong> As addressed in our Privacy Statement, Ancestry commits not to share any Personal Information of AncestryHealth® Users with insurance companies, employers, or third party marketers. Ancestry does not voluntarily cooperate with law enforcement. To provide our Users with the greatest protection under the law, we require all government agencies seeking access to Ancestry customers’ data to follow a valid legal process, and do not allow law enforcement to use Ancestry’s services to investigate crimes or to identify human remains.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>16.3.&nbsp;&nbsp;When Do We Share Your Information and Who Are the Recipients?</strong></p>

<p>Ancestry will share your Health Activation Information, Your Health History, test results, health report, and any questions you submit through the “Submit a Question” feature with the independent physician network who has been appointed as part of the AncestryHealth® Service. The independent physician network will use this information to determine your eligibility for the test, to review and provide oversight of the health reports, as well as to assist in providing genetic counseling services to you.</p>

<p><strong>Please note:</strong> The use of your information by the independent physician network, PWNHealth, will be subject to their <a href="http://ancestry-csc.pwnhealth.com/terms-of-use" target="_blank">Terms of Use</a> and <a href="http://ancestry-csc.pwnhealth.com/privacy" target="_blank">Notice of Privacy Practices</a>.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>16.5.&nbsp;&nbsp;What Are Ancestry’s Retention Practices for the AncestryHealth® Service?</strong></p>

<p>Ancestry will retain the Personal Information you provided to the AncestryHealth® Service until you tell us to delete it. This is to ensure that you always have access to your test results, health reports, and to the physician network service which is included as part of the AncestryHealth® Service. In addition, if you have purchased an update to the AncestryHealth® Service, you may be entitled to receive results to new tests as they become available, and Ancestry will need access to your Personal Information in order to provide this service.</p>

<p><strong>17.5&nbsp;&nbsp;Exercising Your Rights Under CCPA. </strong></p>

<p><a name="exercising-rights"></a><strong>17.5.1&nbsp;&nbsp;Exercising Your Rights Under CCPA. </strong>The CCPA gives California consumers the right to request that we disclose what Personal Information we collect, use, disclose, or sell. This includes the right to request the categories of Personal Information we have collected about them, the categories of sources of Personal Information, the business purpose for collecting Personal Information, the categories of third parties with whom we share categories of Personal Information, and the specific pieces of Personal Information we have collected about the requestor.</p>

<p>If you are submitting a request to know on your own behalf, there are two ways to make your request: online or by email.</p>

<p>To submit your request to know online:</p>

<ol class="numbered">
	<li>Log into your Ancestry account.</li>
	<li>Go to your <a class="underline" href="/secure/account" target="_blank">Account Settings</a>.</li>

</ol>

<p>For your convenience, here are <a class="underline" href="/s/article/Requesting-a-Download-of-Your-Account-Data" target="_blank">step-by-step instructions</a> on how to download your account data.</p>

<p>To email your request to know, email us at <a href="mailto:ccpasupport@ancestry.com">ccpasupport@ancestry.com</a>. We are required to verify your identity before providing you with a copy of your data. We will require you to provide proof of identity and California address (e.g., you may be required to provide a copy of your government ID, which will be used solely to verify your identity and address).</p>

<p><strong>Please note</strong>: In response to a request to know under the CCPA, we will not provide unique biometric information to you. Your DNA Data belongs to you and you may download it at any time. If you download your DNA Data, you do so at your own risk. Learn how <a class="underline" href="/s/article/Downloading-AncestryDNA-Raw-Data" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>

<p>If you are an “Authorized Agent” pursuant to the CCPA and are submitting a request to know on behalf of one of our users, see Section <a href="#authorized-agents">17.5.3</a> below.</p>

<p><strong>17.5.2&nbsp;&nbsp;Right to Delete. </strong>The CCPA gives California consumers the right to request that we delete your Personal Information.</p>

<p>If you are submitting a request to delete on your own behalf, there are two ways to make your request: online or by email. Note that to delete your Personal Information, you must delete your account and that once an account deletion request is completed, this process is irreversible. Your information (including, but not limited to, family trees, records, photos, DNA Data and AncestryHealth® results) will be permanently deleted.</p>

<p>To submit your request for deletion online:</p>

<p><a name="authorized-agents"></a><strong>17.5.3&nbsp;&nbsp;Authorized Agents. </strong>The CCPA allows California residents to use “authorized agents” to make requests to know and requests for deletion. To use an authorized agent, email us at <a href="mailto:thirdpartyauthorizationrequests@ancestry.com">thirdpartyauthorizationrequests@ancestry.com</a>.

	<li>Signed permission from the consumer allowing the authorized agent to act on the consumer’s behalf.</li>
